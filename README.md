## How to run

For each peer in the system, run the following command: ``go run main.go -port=<PORT> -receiver=<RECEIVER_PORT>``
For each peer, <PORT> is its port, while <RECEIVER_PORT> is the port of the peer that the current peer is connected to.
Make sure all the peers are connected in a circle.
